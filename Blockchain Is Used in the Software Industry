Anyone using an application developed using blockchain technology can view and add a record to the database but can’t delete or modify the database record. Limited access ensures robust databases, which improve data integrity as well.

Blockchain uses a distributed database to store records to make them accessible and secure. This technology is safe and protects against unauthorized access. Built on peer-to-peer technology, it eliminates the need for a centralized data repository. It is a robust and secure technology that is used for developing software applications. You say it is accessible to everyone, and right after that it protects against unauthorized access.

Blockchain technology acts as a propeller in software quality assurance, ensuring security, which is vital in the finance industry.

Many renowned companies are exploring opportunities to integrate blockchain technology into their databases to ensure their security. For instance, General Electric is planning to implement blockchain-developed databases in their Aviation Division plans. They’re also working on software that could manage sales, tracking, record-keeping, inventory details with high-end security, transparency, and integrity.
