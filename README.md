# blockchain
Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system.  A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain. Each block in the chain contains a number of transactions, and every time a new transaction occurs on the blockchain, a record of that transaction is added to every participantâ€™s ledger. The decentralised database managed by multiple participants is known as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).  Blockchain is a type of DLT in which transactions are recorded with an immutable cryptographic signature called a hash.
